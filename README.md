# Divide and Conquer Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates **Divide and Conquer algorithms** with interactive visualizations. The platform allows users to explore algorithm behavior for classical problems such as:  

- **Matrix Multiplication**  
- **Closest Pair of Points**  

The interface is designed to be intuitive, providing both **visual demonstrations** and **step-by-step exploration** of the algorithms.

## Features

### 1. Matrix Multiplication Visualization
- Users can input two matrices of compatible size.  
- The application visualizes the **step-by-step multiplication** using the Divide and Conquer approach.  
- Each recursive step is highlighted for clarity, showing how the problem is divided into subproblems and combined to get the final result.

### 2. Closest Pair of Points Visualization
- Users can generate a set of random points on a 2D plane.  
- The algorithm uses the **Divide and Conquer technique** to find the closest pair efficiently.  
- The visualization highlights how the set of points is split recursively, how distances are calculated, and the merging step that identifies the closest pair.

### 3. UI Overview
- The user interface is designed for **clarity and ease of use**.  
- Users can switch between algorithms, enter input data, and view results dynamically.  
- The UI also displays intermediate steps, recursion trees, and visual cues to help users understand the Divide and Conquer approach.

## Notes
- The visualizations are **interactive**, allowing users to pause, step forward, or reset the algorithm.  
- The project helps in understanding **recursive problem-solving**, **subproblem combination**, and **algorithm efficiency** in a visual way.
